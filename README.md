# Next.js Training - Class Projects

Welcome to the Next.js Training repository! Each class has its own project folder containing the codebase for that session. Follow the steps below to run the projects locally.

## Steps to Run a Project

1. **Navigate to the Class Folder**  
   Open your terminal and navigate to the specific class folder you want to run. For example:

   ```bash
   cd class-01
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**  
   Start the local development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**  
   Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure you have **Node.js** (v18 or later) and **npm** installed on your machine.
- Each class folder is self-contained, so you need to run the above commands for each project individually.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance your learning experience!

Happy coding!
